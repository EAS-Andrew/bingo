# Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents 3 bugs found and fixed in the OSRS Board Game codebase. The bugs included logic errors, performance issues, and potential runtime errors.

## Bug 1: Hardcoded Board Reference Bug (Logic Error)

### Description
The application was using hardcoded references to `boardTiles.length` instead of the dynamic `boardData.length` in several places. This created inconsistency between the actual board being used and the reference board.

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Type**: Logic Error
- Teams would be moved to incorrect positions when using the "Move to end" button
- Progress calculations would be wrong when using a custom board
- Board length displays would show incorrect values

### Location
- Line 1103: `updateTeamPosition(team.id, boardTiles.length)` 
- Line 1127: `const progress = (team.position / boardTiles.length) * 100`
- Line 1128: `const currentTile = boardTiles.find(t => t.id === team.position)`
- Line 1137: `{team.position}/{boardTiles.length} • {Math.round(progress)}%`

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Before
onClick={() => updateTeamPosition(team.id, boardTiles.length)}
const progress = (team.position / boardTiles.length) * 100;
const currentTile = boardTiles.find(t => t.id === team.position);
{team.position}/{boardTiles.length} • {Math.round(progress)}%

// After  
onClick={() => updateTeamPosition(team.id, boardData.length)}
const progress = (team.position / boardData.length) * 100;
const currentTile = boardData.find(t => t.id === team.position);
{team.position}/{boardData.length} • {Math.round(progress)}%
```

### Explanation
The fix ensures that all references use the dynamic `boardData` array, which represents the actual board in use, rather than the static `boardTiles` array which is just the default board configuration.

## Bug 2: Fairy Ring Array Out of Bounds Bug (Logic Error)

### Description
The fairy ring teleportation logic assumed all fairy rings would have exactly 3 destination options, but fairy rings can have 2 or more options. This caused an undefined array access when `fairyOptions[2]` was accessed but only 2 options existed.

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Type**: Logic Error / Runtime Error
- Causes runtime errors when landing on fairy rings with only 2 destination options
- Results in `undefined` destination causing incorrect game behavior
- Could potentially crash the application

### Location
- Lines 375-385: Fairy ring teleportation logic in `animateTeamMove` function

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Before
if (fairyRoll <= 2) {
  destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[0];
} else if (fairyRoll <= 4) {
  destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[1];
} else {
  destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[2]; // Bug: Could be undefined!
}

// After
const numOptions = landedTile.fairyOptions.length;
if (numOptions === 1) {
  destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[0];
} else if (numOptions === 2) {
  destination = fairyRoll <= 3 ? landedTile.fairyOptions[0] : landedTile.fairyOptions[1];
} else {
  // 3 or more options - distribute evenly
  if (fairyRoll <= 2) {
    destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[0];
  } else if (fairyRoll <= 4) {
    destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[1];
  } else {
    destination = landedTile.fairyOptions[2] || landedTile.fairyOptions[0]; // fallback
  }
}
```

### Explanation
The fix adds proper bounds checking and handles fairy rings with different numbers of options (1, 2, or 3+). It ensures fair distribution of teleportation probabilities and includes a fallback to prevent undefined destinations.

## Bug 3: useEffect Missing Dependencies Bug (Performance Issue)

### Description
The useEffect hook for keyboard shortcuts was missing the `connectionMode` dependency, which could cause stale closures and incorrect behavior when the connection mode state changes. Additionally, state setter functions were unnecessarily included in the dependency array.

### Impact
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Type**: Performance Issue / Potential Logic Error
- Stale closures could cause incorrect behavior when keyboard shortcuts are used
- Missing dependencies could cause the effect to not update when it should
- Unnecessary dependencies could cause excessive re-renders

### Location
- Line 541: useEffect dependency array

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Before
}, [isEditMode, userRole, editingTile, addNewTile, deleteTile, setIsEditMode, setEditingTile]);

// After
}, [isEditMode, userRole, editingTile, connectionMode, addNewTile, deleteTile]);
```

### Explanation
The fix adds the missing `connectionMode` dependency which is used in the keyboard event handlers, and removes the state setter functions (`setIsEditMode`, `setEditingTile`) as they are stable and don't need to be in the dependency array.

---

## Summary

### Bugs Fixed
1. **Hardcoded Board Reference Bug**: Fixed 4 instances of using static board reference instead of dynamic board
2. **Fairy Ring Array Out of Bounds Bug**: Added proper bounds checking and fallback logic
3. **useEffect Missing Dependencies Bug**: Added missing dependency and cleaned up unnecessary ones

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test the "Move to end" button with custom boards to verify correct positioning
2. Test fairy ring teleportation with rings that have 1, 2, and 3+ destination options
3. Test keyboard shortcuts in different modes (edit mode, connection mode, etc.)
4. Verify progress calculations are accurate with custom boards

### Impact Assessment
- **Security**: No security vulnerabilities were introduced or fixed
- **Performance**: Improved performance by fixing unnecessary re-renders in useEffect
- **Reliability**: Significantly improved reliability by preventing runtime errors and logic bugs
- **User Experience**: Enhanced user experience by ensuring correct game behavior

All fixes are backward compatible and maintain the existing functionality while fixing the underlying issues.
